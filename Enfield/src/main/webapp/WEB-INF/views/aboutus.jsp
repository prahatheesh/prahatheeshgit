 <h6>The Enfield Cycle Company made motorcycles, bicycles, lawnmowers</h6> 
 <h6>and stationary engines under the name Royal Enfield of its works</h6> 
 <h6>based at Redditch, Worcestershire.The legacy of weapons manufacture</h6> 
 <h6>is relected in the logo comprising the cannon, and the motto "Made like a gun".</h6> 
 <h6>Use of the brand name Royal Enfield was licensed by the Crown in 1890.</h6>
 
 <h6>In 1909 Royal Enfield surprised the motorcycling world by introducing a small Motorcycle</h6> 
 <h6>with a 2 ¼ HP V twin Motosacoche engine of Swiss origin. In 1911 the next model was powered</h6>
 <h6>by a 2 ¾ HP engine and boasted of the well known Enfield 2-speed gear. In 1912 came the JAP 6</h6> 
 <h6>HP 770 CC V twin with a sidecar combination. It was this motorcycle which made Enfield a household name.</h6>
 <h6>1914 saw the 3 HP motorcycles this time with Enfields own engine which now had the standardised Enfield</h6> 
 <h6>paint scheme of black enamelled parts and green tank with gold trim.</h6>
